/**
 * Confines each configured plane hostname to its own path prefix. Mounted
 * once at the root of `app.ts`, ahead of both plane routers — it decides
 * which plane (if any) a request is allowed to reach before either
 * router's own auth middleware runs.
 *
 * A request's `Host` header (port stripped, so `api.domainproof.dev:443`
 * and `api.domainproof.dev` behave the same) is checked against the two
 * configured hostnames:
 *
 * - Host matches `publicApiHost` and the path isn't under `/v1` -> 404.
 * - Host matches `dashboardApiHost` and the path isn't under `/dashboard` -> 404.
 * - Everything else — an unconfigured plane, an unmatched host
 *   (`localhost`, `*.up.railway.app`), or neither var set at all —
 *   passes through untouched. Local dev, tests, and the Railway service
 *   domain never see this restriction; no `/etc/hosts` games required to
 *   exercise either plane.
 *
 * The rejection is a plain 404 through the shared `{ error: { code,
 * message } }` taxonomy — the same shape and status an unmatched route
 * gets, not a 403. A 403 would tell a caller "this route exists but you
 * can't have it," which confirms the other plane's routes exist on this
 * host at all. 404 says nothing lives here, indistinguishable from any
 * other wrong path.
