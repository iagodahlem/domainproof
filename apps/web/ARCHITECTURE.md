# Architecture — apps/web

This is the layer map for `apps/web`: where new code goes, and how the
shape is enforced. It's a peer to the root [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../ARCHITECTURE.md),
which explicitly leaves `apps/web` out of its own map — this doc is what
fills that gap, in the same register.

```

`Header` itself is a generic primitive in `packages/ui` (it takes arbitrary
`left`/`right` slots) — there's no app-level Header wrapper to maintain in
`apps/web`. `components/header/` holds the marketing pages' own slot
content (`AuthCta`, the `GoogleIcon` it renders, and `MarketingActions`,
the theme-toggle + CTA cluster shared by the landing and design-system
headers), promoted out of route-private status because it's the natural
companion to every route's own `<Header left=... right=... />`
composition.

## Where does X go?

| Task                                                                                              | Goes in                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New UI primitive with no business meaning (a `Badge` variant, a new `Table` cell type)            | `packages/ui/src/<name>.tsx` (+ export from `index.ts`) — only if it stays app-agnostic (no Clerk, no `next/navigation`, no `fetch`)            |
| New component used by exactly one route                                                           | That route's own `_components/<name>.tsx` — never `apps/web/components/`                                                                        |
| New component you're building for one route today but expect another route to need soon           | Still that route's `_components/` — promote it to `apps/web/components/` the day a second real call site appears, not before                    |
| New piece of the dashboard shell (nav item, topbar affordance, sidebar element)                   | `apps/web/components/dashboard-shell/<name>.tsx`                                                                                                |
| New piece of the shared Header's slot content (a marketing-only or dashboard-only CTA)            | `apps/web/components/header/<name>.tsx`                                                                                                         |
| New dashboard API endpoint the web app needs to call                                              | A new method on `apps/web/lib/api/dashboard.ts` (or a new `lib/api/<plane>.ts` file if it's a different plane)                                  |
| New client-side data need (fetch/refetch/mutate from a `'use client'` component)                  | A new hook in `apps/web/lib/query/<resource>.ts`, wrapping the matching `lib/api` call — the component calls the hook, never `lib/api` directly |
| Initial-render data a server component/layout/page needs                                          | Call `lib/api` directly, same as today — no hook needed, there's no client cache to seed                                                        |
| New pure helper with no fetch/React (formatting, parsing, `slugPreview`-style)                    | `apps/web/lib/<name>.ts`, flat                                                                                                                  |
| New route-private non-component helper (a route's own formatter, a constant only that route uses) | That route's own `_lib/<name>.ts`                                                                                                               |
| New marketing-only or dashboard-only route                                                        | Inside the matching route group                                                                                                                 |
| New internal/dev-only route (a showcase, a debug page)                                            | Its own top-level `app/<name>/` folder, outside both route groups, with its own `_components/`                                                  |

## Naming conventions

- **Route-private folders are always `_components/` (React components) and
  `_lib/` (non-component helpers)** — Next's own private-folder convention,
  so they're never mistaken for a routable segment and (per Enforcement
  below) never reachable through the `@/` root alias from outside their own
  route.
- **`apps/web/components/` subfolders are named for what they are, not
  "misc."** `header/` and `dashboard-shell/` are closed sets, the same way
  an api module's root file set is closed (root `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "Module
  anatomy") — a new file lands there only if it's genuinely part of that
  shell/header, not because it's "kind of dashboard-related."
- **Query hooks are named `use<Verb><Resource>`** (`useCreateProject`,
  `useRotateOrRevokeApiKey`, `useWebhookDeliveries`), one file per resource
  in `lib/query/`, deliberately mirroring `lib/api/dashboard.ts`'s own
  per-resource method grouping.

## Enforcement

- **`no-restricted-imports`** (see `apps/web/eslint.config.mjs`) mechanically
  enforces two shapes:
  1. **No aliased cross-route private imports.** `@/app/*/_components/**`,
     `@/app/**/_components/**`, `@/app/*/_lib/**`, and `@/app/**/_lib/**`
     are banned repo-wide. A route only ever imports its own private folder
     by relative path (`./_components/x`, `../_components/x`) — no
     legitimate colocated usage ever needs the alias to reach one. The
     residual gap this can't cheaply catch — a relative import that climbs
     from one route into a sibling's private folder — is what the
     `frontend-reviewer` agent's rule 16 exists for instead.
  2. **Client components consume data through the query layer, not
     `lib/api` directly.** `apps/web/components/**` and
     `apps/web/app/**/_components/**` may not import `@/lib/api/*` as a
     value — only `@/lib/query/*` (type-only imports of response shapes
     like `ProjectSummary` are allowed, since those are the vocabulary the
     whole component tree passes around as props). Route files themselves
     (`page.tsx`/`layout.tsx`/`loading.tsx`) are the exception, same as only
     a module's `repository.ts` is allowed to import `@infra/db` on the api
     side. `lib/query/**` may import `@/lib/api/*` — that's its entire job.
  - **Known, explicit exception:** `EventsView`'s `loadMore` still
    hand-rolls its own fetch/state rather than going through `lib/query` —
    converting it is a real behavior change (new request
    de-duplication/caching semantics via TanStack Query), not a structural
    move, so it's deliberately deferred to an immediate follow-on PR. The
    import is marked with an inline `eslint-disable-next-line` rather than
    silently exempted.
- **The `frontend-reviewer` agent** (`.claude/agents/frontend-reviewer.md`)
  reviews what eslint can't cheaply express: a component earning its place
  in `apps/web/components/` by actual cross-route use rather than
  anticipated use, and the residual cross-route private-import case
  described above.
